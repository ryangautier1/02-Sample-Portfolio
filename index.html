        <article>My name is Ryan Gautier and I am a student at the University of Texas Full Stack Coding Bootcamp.
          I am from Frisco, TX, and have lived in Austin since the summer of 2017. I studied mechanical engineering at
          Texas A&M University, where I graduated with a
          Bachelor of Science degree in May of 2017. Following graduation, I worked as an engineering
          technician, where I assembled power supply equipment for semiconductor
          manufacturing machinery. After doing that work for about a year, I took a position as an electrical
          utilities design engineer. My role in that position was to manage up to seventy projects at a time,
          doing the engineering and administrative work involved for each project. I held that position for about a year
          and
          a half, until I finally decided to change my career path toward web development.
          <br><br>
          My first exposure to coding was in my undergraduate education, where I learned Matlab. I used Matlab
          to develop various programs, such as simulating a car's suspension system response over vairous road
          conditions. I continued studying various coding languages in my free time, and finally decided to persue
          a web development career. I enjoy coding because of the feeling of satisfaction I get when my code works
          the way it is intended to. I am set up to graduate from my coding bootcamp on June 1st, 2020. I am excited
          to see what my future has in store for me in the field of web development!
